# ETDMSCrosswalk
The DSpace 1.2.x ETDMS crosswalk

In 2005, whilst developing/administrating the MSpace repository system here at UManitoba, We needed a way for Library Archive of Canada
(LAC) to scoop up our graduate theses and their preferred metadata standard was ETDMS. No one had written a ETDMS crosswalk for DSpace
at that point, so I did.
This is the original code with the original README file from 2005. Please excuse any awful java code. I believe the code has been sent out
to a few developers in the past via email and I thought I had lost the code until recently.
The code could be useful if you're running a 1.2.x system or if you'd like to upgrade it to use the more recent API. Enjoy!.
